DFS stands for Depth First Search. 
It is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

During the traversal, it keeps track of visited nodes to ensure that it doesnâ€™t revisit a node that has already been visited.

DFS can be used to solve a variety of problems such as 
  finding connected components, 
  detecting cycles in a graph, and 
  generating mazes. It can also be used to perform 
  topological sorting

DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack data structure
