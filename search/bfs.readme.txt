BFS traverses the graph by visiting all the vertices in the same level, and then moves to the next level.
It uses a queue data structure to maintain the order of traversal, and a visited array to keep track of the visited vertices.

BFS can be used to solve various graph problems, such as 
  finding the shortest path between two vertices,
  detecting cycles in a graph, and 
  checking whether a graph is bipartite.
