  pivot table OR graph

representation graph as 
graph = {
  'v1': ['v2', 'v3'],
  'v2': ['v4'],
}
is for cases when we know whole graph before task.

Case We do not know whole graph structure before task
can use representation graph as set of 
Node {
  nextVertex: [refV1, refV2]
}

Representation for storing additional data in vertex or edge
