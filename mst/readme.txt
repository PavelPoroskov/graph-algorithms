MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) is 
a subset of edges in an undirected graph that connects all vertices of the graph with the minimum possible total edge weight. 
In other words, it is the tree that spans all the vertices of a graph with the minimum sum of edge weights.

Applications of primâ€™s algorithm are 
  Travelling Salesman Problem, 
  Network for roads and 
  Rail tracks connecting all the cities etc.

Applications of Kruskal algorithm are
